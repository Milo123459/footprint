# üêæ footprint
üêæ Footprint is the all-in-one project manager for Git.

## The idea

The idea of footprint, is to make one tool, for managing git projects. With contributing in mind, and project ownership. I built this tool as a way of fixing a problem: **Git sucks**. Well, sucks on it's *own*. Contributing to projects requires forking, then cloning, then making a new branch, then making a pull request. This takes time, valuable time, time when you could be doing what you do best - coding. Well, footprint is designed to lead you down a path to a world, where Git has streamlined and optimized workflows.

Commands like `git status` show information you don't care about, or need. **footprint** simplfies it. Rather then running `git status`, it's simply `footprint status`, or, `fp status`. 

Get back to doing what you do best, not messing with Git.
